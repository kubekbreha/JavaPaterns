# JavaPatterns

In this project I just show some of design patterns which I learning for my exam. I upload it to git so you can benefit from this examples too.
As you may notice not all patterns are implemented yet. You need to give me some time ;)

## Install

You can download what ever folder and in it you can find whole InetelliJ project which you can run on your computer.
If you want olny .java files you navigate like this (pattern)/src/com/patterns/ and there you can find theese files.

* Creational patterns ->
    Deal with initializing and configuring classes and objects
